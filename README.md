# LM Bridge Development Source

**A Local API Bridge - _FAST_ queries, no remote server issues**

**_This is the source repo to build the LM-Bridge project_**
and contains the LM-Bridge container plus related tooling.

1. A Lidarr Metadata Server image that bridges to a MusicBrainz mirror
2. Media format filtering - remove any format from Lidarr (like vinyl)
3. Before/After API hooks allowing third parties to insert plugin-like code to manipulate json and database queries, including addind other external databases

**_Thanks to blampe and Typnull for inspiration_** : this wouldn't have been possible without leveraging their previous work

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **_For the premade Docker container: https://github.com/HVR88/LM-Bridge_**
>
> **Plugin status**:
> References here are historical; this repo no longer builds or publishes a plugin.

Deploy-only files live in `deploy/` (`docker-compose.yml`, `compose/`, `.env.example`). You can copy that folder as-is, or run `scripts/export-deploy.sh` to create a bundle or sync it to a separate deploy repo (the export excludes `.env` by default).

Hook documentation is in `hooks_readme.md` (custom DB/MITM transforms that run after built-in processing).

## Source Repo Summary

**What This Repo Does**

1. Builds an amd64 container image with Lidarr Metadata Server
2. Adds a bridge config so you can point at your MusicBrainz mirror
3. Hosts the completed container distribution via versioned releases

**What This Repo Doesn't Do**

1. **It's not a ready-to-deploy container image**
2. It doesn't build or run the MusicBrainz mirror stack
3. It doesn't build or run Lidarr

**Requirements**

1. Running Lidarr _nightly_ branch
2. Running MusicBrainz mirror server

**Key Defaults**

1. MusicBrainz DB defaults to user `musicbrainz` and password `musicbrainz`
2. LM-BRIDGE cache DB defaults user `lmbridge` and password `lmbridge`

## Configuration of the LM Bridge Container

Edit `deploy/compose/lm-bridge-hosted-services.yml` to match your environment. This file is a standalone Compose file for the LM-Bridge container.

Important fields:

- `PROVIDERS__MUSICBRAINZDBPROVIDER__1__DB_HOST` should point to your MusicBrainz DB host or service name.
- `PROVIDERS__SOLRSEARCHPROVIDER__1__SEARCH_SERVER` should point to your Solr endpoint.
- `POSTGRES_CACHE_HOST` should point to the Postgres host that will hold `lm_cache_db`.

If you want to use Docker service names like `db`, `search`, or `redis`, run this container on the same Docker network as your MusicBrainz mirror.

For best metadata enrichment, set API keys for TheAudioDB and Fanart.tv via `TADB_KEY` and `FANART_KEY` (in `deploy/compose/lm-bridge-hosted-services.yml` or via environment variables).

## Initialize LMBRIDGE Cache DB and MusicBrainz Indexes

This repo includes `scripts/init-mbdb.sh` to handle the database prep that used to be done inside the mirror stack.
If you are upgrading from the legacy cache user `lidarr` or `abc`, the script will automatically migrate ownership to the new cache user and update the password.

Run it once after your MusicBrainz mirror is up:

```bash
MB_DB_HOST=your-mb-host \
MB_DB_USER=musicbrainz \
MB_DB_PASSWORD=musicbrainz \
scripts/init-mbdb.sh
```

If you do not have `psql` installed locally, the script will use a temporary `postgres` container. In that case, provide the MusicBrainz Docker network so it can resolve service names like `db`:

```bash
MB_DB_HOST=db \
MB_DB_NETWORK=musicbrainz_default \
scripts/init-mbdb.sh
```

You can change cache DB settings if needed:

```bash
LMBRIDGE_CACHE_DB=lm_cache_db \
LMBRIDGE_CACHE_USER=lmbridge \
LMBRIDGE_CACHE_PASSWORD=lmbridge \
scripts/init-mbdb.sh
```

Optional cache schema and fail-open:

```bash
LMBRIDGE_CACHE_SCHEMA=lm_cache \
LMBRIDGE_CACHE_FAIL_OPEN=true \
scripts/init-mbdb.sh
```

The script also creates the cache tables (`fanart`, `tadb`, `wikipedia`, `artist`, `album`, `spotify`) inside `lm_cache_db` to avoid runtime errors like `relation "tadb" does not exist`.

## Technical - Build And Run

### Clone

Recommended (pulls the upstream submodule automatically):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/HVR88/LM-Bridge.git
```

If you already cloned without submodules:

```bash
cd lm-bridge
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Use the helper script (defaults to `linux/amd64` and tag `lm-bridge:latest`):

```bash
scripts/build-image.sh
```

Override defaults:

```bash
PLATFORMS=linux/amd64 LMBRIDGE_IMAGE=lm-bridge:latest scripts/build-image.sh
```

Multi-arch build (push required):

```bash
PLATFORMS=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 PUSH=1 LMBRIDGE_IMAGE=lm-bridge:latest scripts/build-image.sh
```

Start the container using the provided settings file (Compose will pull the image if it doesn't exist locally):

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/lm-bridge-hosted-services.yml up -d
```

Note: Deploy files default to `espressomatic/lm-bridge:latest`. If you build locally, set `LMBRIDGE_IMAGE` to your tag.

If you want to run it on the **same Docker network** as your MusicBrainz mirror and auto-run the **init container**, use the repo’s root `docker-compose.yml` (it’s already there if you cloned the repo). Then run:

```bash
MB_NETWORK=musicbrainz_default docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The `init` container will exit after completing setup. That is expected.

If you use custom image tags, set them via environment:

```bash
LMBRIDGE_IMAGE=lm-bridge:latest \
MB_NETWORK=musicbrainz_default \
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Note: `MB_DB_USER` must have permission to create roles and databases (the mirror's primary Postgres user usually does).

If your Docker Compose version does not support `include` (used by `docker-compose.yml`), you can still run the underlying file directly:

```bash
MB_NETWORK=musicbrainz_default docker compose -f deploy/compose/lm-bridge-docker-network.yml up -d
```

If you are building from source, add the dev override:

```bash
MB_NETWORK=musicbrainz_default docker compose -f deploy/compose/lm-bridge-docker-network.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Verify

Once running, test a known artist endpoint:

```bash
curl http://host-ip:5001/artist/1921c28c-ec61-4725-8e35-38dd656f7923
```

If the bridge is configured correctly, you should see JSON metadata from your mirror.

If it fails, check logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api
```

## Docker Hub Release (Manual)

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that can build and push the image to Docker Hub on demand.

Required secrets:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

In GitHub: **Actions → Docker Hub Release → Run workflow**.
